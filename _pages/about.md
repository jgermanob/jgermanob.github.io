I am a PhD student in the [UKP lab](https://www.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/ukp/ukp_home/index.en.jsp) at the [Institute for Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence and Technology (INSAIT)](https://insait.ai/)  where I am working on multimodal fact-checking under the supervision of [Prof. Iryna Gurevych](https://www.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/ukp/ukp_home/head_ukp/index.en.jsp).

Previously, I served as a Research Assistant at the [Mohamed bin Zayed University of Artifical Intelligence (MBZUAI)](https://ritual-uh.github.io/web/), focusing on parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques for Large Language Models (LLMs) under the guidance of [Prof. Thamar Solorio](https://mbzuai.ac.ae/study/faculty/thamar-solorio/).


I completed my MSc in Computer Science at the [Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México (UNAM)](http://english.unam.mx), where I had the privilege of being advised by [Dr Gemma Bel-Engix](https://www.iingen.unam.mx/es-mx/Investigacion/Academicos/Paginas/GBelE.aspx).
