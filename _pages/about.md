I have a master's degree in computer science from the Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México (UNAM) and was fortunate to be advised by **Dr Gemma Bel-Engix**.

As a master's student, I specialised in deep learning for natural language understanding. I proposed a novel architecture based on pre-trained language models for sentence pairs tasks during my thesis project. 

Currently, I am a Research Assistant at MBZUAI, working on parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques for LLMs under the supervision of [Prof. Thamar Solorio](https://mbzuai.ac.ae/study/faculty/thamar-solorio/).
